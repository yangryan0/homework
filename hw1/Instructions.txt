Preliminary Steps:
1. Generate samples/expert rollouts: Run "./generate_rollouts.sh" (Take note of the means and SDs for the expert policies)
2. Create a folder "logs" and subdirectories under this folder "average_rewards" and "csv"
3. Generate results: Run "./run_cloning.sh" (Will generate results for both DAgger and behvaioral cloning)

Questions:
Navigate to the ./logs/average_rewards directory and open the IPython Notebook titled GenerateFigures.ipynb
Q2.1. I made the chart manually by inputting the Mean and SD of each task at the last epoch after running behavioral cloning.
Change the path in Cell 2 to get the average rewards and SD for each task after behavioral cloning.
Q2.2 Run Cell 1
Q3.2 Run Cell 3
Q4.1 Run Cell 4
